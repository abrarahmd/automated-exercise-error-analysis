### Detailed Comparison of Reference and User Frames

#### Mistakes Identified:
1. **Mistake: Neck Pulling**
   - **Explanation**: In the user frames, the neck appears to be pulled forward or strained, especially noticeable in the middle and end frames. This is evident from the alignment of the head and neck, which deviates from the straight line observed in the reference frames. The head should remain neutral and in line with the spine to maintain proper alignment.

2. **Mistake: Lack of Chin Tuck**
   - **Explanation**: The user is not tucking their chin, which is crucial for maintaining a neutral spine position. In the reference frames, the chin is tucked slightly, keeping the head in alignment with the torso. In contrast, the user's head is more extended, indicating a lack of proper chin tuck.

3. **Mistake: Use of Momentum**
   - **Explanation**: The user appears to be using momentum rather than controlled movement, especially noticeable in the transition from the start to the middle frame. This is evident from the exaggerated movement of the arms and torso, which lacks the smooth, controlled motion seen in the reference frames. Proper form requires controlled, deliberate movements.

4. **Mistake: Poor Alignment**
   - **Explanation**: The user's overall body alignment is off, particularly in the middle and end frames. The shoulders, hips, and knees are not aligned in a straight line, which is critical for exercises like planks or push-ups. In the reference frames, the body forms a straight line from head to heels, indicating proper alignment. The user's body shows a sagging or arched back, which can lead to poor form and increased risk of injury.

### User Instructions:
1. **Maintain Neutral Spine Alignment**:
   - Keep your head in line with your spine. Avoid pulling your neck forward or extending it backward. Focus on a neutral head position with a slight chin tuck.

2. **Controlled Movements**:
   - Avoid using momentum. Ensure each movement is deliberate and controlled. This will help engage the correct muscles and improve form.

3. **Proper Chin Tuck**:
   - Tuck your chin slightly to maintain a neutral head position. This will help keep your neck in alignment with your spine.

4. **Whole Body Alignment**:
   - Ensure your shoulders, hips, and knees are aligned in a straight line. Avoid sagging or arching your back. Keep your core engaged to maintain proper alignment throughout the exercise.

5. **Practice Slowly**:
   - Start with slower, controlled movements to focus on form. Gradually increase speed as you become more comfortable with the correct technique.

By addressing these mistakes and following the provided instructions, the user can improve their workout form and reduce the risk of injury.
