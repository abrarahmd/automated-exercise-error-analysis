### Detailed Comparison and Analysis

#### Reference Frames vs. User Frames
The reference frames show a proper workout form, while the user frames exhibit several mistakes. Below is a detailed comparison focusing on overall patterns such as pulling the neck, tucking the chin, using momentum, and poor alignment.

---

### **Mistake: Pulling the Neck**
- **Reference Frames**: The neck remains neutral and aligned with the spine throughout the movement. The head is in a straight line with the torso.
- **User Frames**: The user is pulling the neck forward, especially noticeable in User Frame 1 and User Frame 3. This can lead to strain on the neck and poor posture.

---

### **Mistake: Tucking the Chin**
- **Reference Frames**: The chin is kept tucked in, maintaining a neutral neck position. This is evident in all reference frames.
- **User Frames**: In User Frame 2, the user's chin is not tucked in, leading to an extended neck posture. This can cause unnecessary strain on the cervical spine.

---

### **Mistake: Using Momentum**
- **Reference Frames**: The movement is controlled and deliberate, with no signs of swinging or bouncing. The body remains stable throughout the exercise.
- **User Frames**: In User Frame 3, there is noticeable bouncing or swinging, indicating the use of momentum rather than controlled muscle engagement. This reduces the effectiveness of the exercise and increases the risk of injury.

---

### **Mistake: Poor Alignment**
- **Reference Frames**: The body is aligned in a straight line from head to heels. The shoulders, hips, and knees are in proper alignment.
- **User Frames**:
  - **User Frame 1**: The hips are sagging, causing a break in the straight line of the body. This can lead to lower back strain.
  - **User Frame 2**: The shoulders are not aligned with the hips, indicating a lack of core engagement.
  - **User Frame 3**: The knees are not properly aligned with the toes, which can lead to knee strain.

---

### **Mistake: Core Engagement**
- **Reference Frames**: The core is engaged, keeping the body stable and maintaining a straight line from head to heels.
- **User Frames**: In all user frames, there is a lack of core engagement, as evidenced by the sagging hips and unstable body position.

---

### **Summary of Mistakes**
1. **Pulling the Neck**: User Frames 1 and 3.
2. **Tucking the Chin**: User Frame 2.
3. **Using Momentum**: User Frame 3.
4. **Poor Alignment**:
   - Hips sagging: User Frame 1.
   - Shoulder misalignment: User Frame 2.
   - Knee misalignment: User Frame 3.
5. **Lack of Core Engagement**: All User Frames.

### **User Instructions**
To correct these mistakes and perform the exercise properly, follow these instructions:

1. **Maintain Neutral Neck Posture**:
   - Keep your neck straight and aligned with your spine.
   - Tuck your chin slightly to avoid extending your neck.

2. **Engage Your Core**:
   - Tighten your abdominal muscles to keep your body stable and in a straight line.
   - Avoid sagging hips or arching your lower back.

3. **Avoid Using Momentum**:
   - Perform the exercise in a controlled manner without bouncing or swinging.
   - Focus on using your muscles to move your body, not relying on momentum.

4. **Ensure Proper Alignment**:
   - Keep your shoulders, hips, and knees aligned in a straight line.
   - Ensure your knees are directly above your ankles.

5. **Practice Mindful Movement**:
   - Focus on each movement to ensure it is deliberate and controlled.
   - Slow down if necessary to maintain proper form.
