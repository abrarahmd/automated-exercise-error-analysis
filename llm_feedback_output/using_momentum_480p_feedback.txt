### Analysis of Workout Frames

#### Reference Frames:
The reference frames show a proper workout execution, likely a push-up or plank variation, with correct alignment and form.

#### User Frames:
The user frames show deviations from the proper form. Here are the mistakes identified:

---

### Mistake: Poor Alignment
- **Explanation**: The user's body is not maintaining a straight line from head to heels. There is a noticeable sagging in the lower back and hips, indicating a lack of core engagement.
  - **Frames Affected**: All user frames (1, 2, 3).

---

### Mistake: Shoulder Position
- **Explanation**: The shoulders are not properly aligned with the elbows. The elbows appear to be flaring outwards, which is incorrect for maintaining stability and targeting the correct muscle groups.
  - **Frames Affected**: All user frames (1, 2, 3).

---

### Mistake: Elbow Position
- **Explanation**: The elbows are not bent at a 90-degree angle or are not positioned close to the body. This affects the distribution of weight and the effectiveness of the exercise.
  - **Frames Affected**: All user frames (1, 2, 3).

---

### Mistake: Head Position
- **Explanation**: The head is not in a neutral position. It appears to be looking up or down, which can lead to neck strain and poor overall form.
  - **Frames Affected**: All user frames (1, 2, 3).

---

### Mistake: Core Engagement
- **Explanation**: The core is not engaged, leading to a sagging posture. This reduces the effectiveness of the exercise and can lead to lower back strain.
  - **Frames Affected**: All user frames (1, 2, 3).

### Summary of Errors:
1. **Poor Alignment**: Body not in a straight line.
2. **Shoulder Position**: Shoulders not aligned with elbows.
3. **Elbow Position**: Elbows not bent at 90 degrees or positioned close to the body.
4. **Head Position**: Head not in a neutral position.
5. **Core Engagement**: Lack of core stability leading to sagging posture.
